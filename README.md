🚀 Banking Management System Project Overview 🚀

I'm excited to share the details of my recent project, a comprehensive Banking Management System that 
seamlessly integrates Spring Boot, React Js, Java, HTML, CSS, and a relational database using SQL. This
multi-tiered application not only demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack development but also showcases
the power of combining robust technologies to create a feature-rich banking solution.

🔧 Key Features:

Spring Boot Backend: Leveraging the power of Spring Boot, the backend is designed for scalability, flexibility, 
and efficient data management. The use of entities like Admin, Customer, and Transaction ensures a well-structured data model.

React Js Frontend: The React Js frontend provides an intuitive user interface, offering a smooth and responsive user
experience. It facilitates seamless interaction with the backend through well-defined API endpoints.

Database Integration: The application utilizes a relational database, and SQL queries ensure data integrity and retrieval
efficiency. Entities like Admin, Customer, and Transaction are meticulously designed to capture the essential aspects of banking operations.

Security Measures: Robust security measures are implemented, including password hashing, unique identifiers generation, and secure
communication between the frontend and backend.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): The application implements CORS to enable secure communication between the React Js frontend and the Spring Boot backend.

RESTful API Endpoints: Well-defined and documented API endpoints enable smooth communication between different layers of the application.
Postman was used for thorough testing of these endpoints, ensuring reliability.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Frontend: React Js, HTML, CSS
Database: SQL (Relational Database)
Testing: Postman

👨‍💻 My Role:

As a Full Stack Developer, I played a key role in designing and implementing the backend (Java, Spring Boot) and 
frontend (React Js) components of a Banking Management System, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

🌐 Project Impact:
This Banking Management System is a testament to my skills in software development and showcases my ability to create robust, 
scalable, and user-friendly applications. It's not just a project; it's a reflection of my dedication to excellence in the world 
of full-stack development.

Feel free to explore the live endpoints and frontend at your convenience, and don't hesitate to reach out for further details or collaboration opportunities!
